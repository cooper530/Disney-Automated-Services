##Disney Fastpass+ Finder

Checks the availability for Walt Disney World Fastpasses

###Getting Started

To start these libraries must be installed:
* Selenium
* Tkinter
* Python 3.5 or later

###How the Program Works

The Fastpass+ Finder uses the Selenium library to automate the process of Fastpass selection.
Information for the requested Fastpass can be aquired in two ways. All information for the
variables can be found within FastpassData.py.

####Method 1:
When prompted, select the GUI interface option to enter information. From there,
use the various drop-down menus and entry fields to enter the information.

####Method 2:
Instead of using Method 1, select the retrieve data from a python file option.
Enter all information in the FastpassData.py file beforehand to use this method.
